# OrderedArrayList
Created OrderedArrayList on github and started discussion
NoNullArray is similar to just ArrayList, with the exception that it throws IllegalArgumentException
Talked about how to deal with extra spaces from constructors (if there's nothing, what do we do?)
Recalled that ArrayList's size() returns the number of filled spaces
decided to use compare() for sorting
